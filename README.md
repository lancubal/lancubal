### 👨‍💻 About Me

"I am a technology and computer enthusiast at heart, but my world extends far beyond the screen. I define myself as a curious mind fueled by compelling stories and powerful chords.

Reading is my main refuge. **Italo Calvino** is my absolute favorite—*Cosmicomics* is perfection to me—but my library is vast and varied. I have a deep love for sci-fi and dystopias, ranging from **Asimov**, **Wells**, and **Dick** to the *Three-Body Problem* trilogy, *Snow Crash*, and classics like *Fahrenheit 451*. I also enjoy the fantasy of *Discworld* and *LOTR*, the horror of **Stephen King** (especially *Salem's Lot* and *The Stand*), and unique voices like **Paul B. Preciado** or **Dostoevsky**. Whether it’s the absurdity of *Hitchhiker's Guide* or the maze of *House of Leaves*, I’m always immersed in a good book.

When I'm not reading or coding, you'll likely find me playing the **guitar**. Music is my other half; I'm a big metal fan, with **DragonForce** and **Black Sabbath** always in heavy rotation. And to clear my head and disconnect from the digital world, **cycling** is my go-to grounding activity."
